    "#### Anomaly Detection using ML\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in other learning problems, we are given a training dataset ${x^{(1)}, x^{(2)},\\dots,x^{(m)}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we're given a test set where we need to find anomalies using this data, by formulating p(x) where a particular data point falls out of what's considered a normal range $\\epsilon$.\n",

    "###### Anomaly Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "- Very small number of positive examples (y=1_. (0-20 is common)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Large number of negative examples (y=0)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Many different 'types' of anomalies. Hard for any algorithm to learn from positive examples what the anomalies look like;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Future anomalies may look nothing like any of the anomalous examples seen so far.\n",

    "###### Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "- Large number of positive and negative examples\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enough positive examples for algorithm to get a sense of what positive examples are like, future positive examples likely to be similar to ones in training set\n",

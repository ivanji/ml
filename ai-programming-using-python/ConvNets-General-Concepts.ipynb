    "### Pretrained Models in ConvNets\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-trained itself means a model which have been already trained on some sort of data set with different number of classes. In deep learning there is a term called “transfer learning”, what does it mean? Well, this concept say that the CNN models have this capability to learn some sort of information from other data-sets. In practice, very few people train an entire Convolutional Network from scratch (with random initialization), because it is relatively rare to have a dataset of sufficient size. Instead, it is common to pre-train a CNN model on a very large dataset (e.g. ImageNet, which contains 1.2 million images with 1000 categories), and then use the this either as an initialization or a fixed feature extractor for the task of interest. The main Transfer Learning approach is\n",

    "Fine-tuning themodel. It is possible to fine-tune all the layers of the ConvNet, or it’s possible to keep some of the earlier layers fixed (due to overfitting concerns) and only fine-tune some higher-level portion of the network. This is motivated by the observation that the earlier features of a ConvNet contain more generic features (e.g. edge detectors or color blob detectors) that should be useful to many tasks, but later layers of the ConvNet becomes progressively more specific to the details of the classes contained in the original dataset. In case of ImageNet for example, which contains many dog breeds, a significant portion of the representational power of the ConvNet may be devoted to features that are specific to differentiating between dog breeds.\n",
